## Documentation for business card

This page was made using a basic starter code from my professor. I worked in html to remove old text and replace it with my name, title, images and svgs. In CSS, I brought in my specifc typefaces and lineweights to stylize my name and title. From there, I was able to choose the colors. The card for the background itself, the webpage background, and the images on the card were created and documented by me. This was my first experience coding and working with html and CSS to create a site that had custom images and interactivity, so I did run into slight issues. One of the major challenges I faced was replacing the old social media icons with the ones that I created. They were inserted incorrectly so they were not clickable and did not work with hover interactions. Another challenge was inserting the images of my artwork properly. I had to tinker with the position property in order to resize and place them where I wanted them to be. Despite the challenges I faced, I was able to recieve help from my instructor to fix the major problems. Overall, I am proud of what I was able to create; the finished site closely resembles what I envisioned at the beginning stages.
